				<h2 class="section-header">Alpha Kappa Psi</h2>
				
				<p class="section-text">Founded in 1904, Alpha Kappa Psi is the nation's oldest co-ed professional business fraternity, and with over 250 Chapters in the United States, Europe, and Canada, it is also the largest. The chapter here at Carnegie Mellon University is the Omega Psi Chapter. As brothers, we not only strive to improve the educational experience and future opportunities for one another, but also to strengthen the brotherhood between us and the fraternity as a whole. We hold ourselves to high ethical standards, and seek to improve our community as well as our Alma Mater.Becoming a brother of Alpha Kappa Psi is a major commitment, but it is an incredibly rewarding experience, one which lasts a lifetime.</p>
